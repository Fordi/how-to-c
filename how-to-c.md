Writing C
---------

> The first rule of C is don't write C if you can avoid it.

<cite>- [Jan-Erik Rediger]</cite>

C provides a lot of power, speed, flexibility, and lifetime to code, however, C
gives you, as the 1995 spiritual predecessor to this document informs you
eponymously, [Enough Rope to Shoot Yourself In the Foot].  Whether or not you
use C is a broad topic, largely out of scope for this document.  Whatever your
opinion on the topic, if you must write your software using C, you should
follow modern rules - whenever "modern" happens to be.

C has been around since the [early 1970s]. People have "learned C" at various
points during its evolution, but knowledge usually get stuck after learning, so
everybody has a different set of things they believe about C based on the
year(s) they first started learning.

It's important to not remain stuck in your "things I learned in the 80s/90s"
mindset of C development.

This page assumes you are on a modern platform conforming to modern standards
and you have no excessive legacy compatibility requirements. We shouldn't be
globally tied to ancient standards just because some companies refuse to
upgrade 20 year old systems.

Preflight
---------

Standard c99 (c99 means "C Standard from 1999"; c11 means "C Standard from
2011", so 11 &gt; 99).

* clang, default
    * clang uses an extended version of C11 by default (`GNU C11 mode`), so no
        extra options are needed for modern features. _If you want standard
        C11, you need to specify `-std=c11`; if you want standard C99, use
        `-std=c99`._ clang compiles your source files faster than gcc.
* gcc requires you specify `-std=c99` or `-std=c11`
    * gcc builds source files slower than clang, but *sometimes* generates
        faster code. Performance comparisons and regression testings are
        important.
    * gcc-5 defaults to `GNU C11 mode` (same as clang).
        * clang and gcc support the [gcc-specific extensions] this enables,
        however, many compilers do not.  If you need wide portability - that is,
        _exactly_ c11 or c99 - you should still specify `-std=c11`
        or `-std=c99`.

Optimizations

* -O2, -O3
    * generally you want `-O2`, but sometimes you want `-O3`. Test under both
    levels (and across compilers) then keep the best performing binaries.
* -Os
    * `-Os` (optimize for size) helps if your concern is cache efficiency
        (which it should be)
* For more information on optimization, see [GCC's optimize options]

Warnings

* `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`
    * [newer compiler versions] have `-Wpedantic`, but they still accept the
    ancient `-pedantic` as well for wider backwards compatibility.
* during testing you should add `-Werror` and `-Wshadow` on all your platforms
    * it can be tricky deploying production source using `-Werror` because
        different platforms and compilers and libraries can emit different
        warnings. You probably don't want to kill a user's entire build just
        because their version of GCC on a platform you've never seen complains
        in new and wonderous ways.
* extra fancy options include `-Wstrict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing`
    * Either specify `-fno-strict-aliasing` or be sure to only access objects
        as the type they have at creation. Since so much existing C code
        aliases across types, using `-fno-strict-aliasing` is a much safer bet
        if you don't control the entire underlying source tree.
* as of now, Clang reports some valid syntax as a warning, so you should add
    `-Wno-missing-field-initializers`
    * GCC fixed this unnecessary warning after GCC 4.7.0

Building

* Compilation units
    * The most common way of building C projects is to decompose every source
        file into an object file then link all the objects together at the end.
        This procedure works great for incremental development, but it is
        suboptimal for performance and optimization. Your compiler can't detect
        potential optimization across file boundaries this way.
* LTO — Link Time Optimization
    * LTO fixes the "source analysis and optimization across compilation units
        problem" by annotating object files with intermediate representation so
        source-aware optimizations can be carried out across compilation units
        at link time (this slows down the linking process noticeably, but `make
        -j` helps).
    * [clang LTO] ([guide])
    * [gcc LTO]
    * As of 2016, clang and
        gcc releases support LTO by just adding `-flto` to your command line
        options during object compilation and final library/program linking.
    * `LTO` still needs some babysitting though. Sometimes, if your program has
        code not used directly but used by additional libraries, LTO can evict
        functions or code because it detects, globally when linking, some code
        is unused/unreachable and doesn't *need* to be included in the final
        linked result.

Arch

* `-march=native`
    * give the compiler permission to use your CPU's full feature set
    * again, performance testing and regression testing is important (then
        comparing the results across multiple compilers and/or compiler
        versions) is important to make sure any enabled optimizations don't
        have adverse side effects.
* `-msse2` and `-msse4.2` may be useful if you need to target
    not-your-build-machine features.

Writing code
------------

### Types

If you find yourself typing `char` or `short` or `long` or `unsigned`
into new code, you should question the purpose of the variable.

`int` is going to be the most "natural" integer type for the current platform -
which may or may not be what you want.  If you want signed integers that are
reasonably fast and are at least 16 bits, there's nothing wrong with using
`int`.  `<stdint.h>`'s int_least16_t`, is usually the same type - they have the
same requirements, at least - but is more verbose than it needs to be.

To ensure consistency in non-storage data types for modern programs, you should
`#include <stdint.h>` then use _standard_ types.

The common standard types are:

* `int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t` — signed integers
* `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, `uint64_t` — unsigned integers
* `float` - 32-bit minimum floating point
* `double` - 64-bit minimum floating point

Developers routinely abuse `char` to mean "byte" even when they are doing
unsigned byte manipulations - however, while `char` is guaranteed to mean a
byte, a byte inly guaranteed to be _at least_ 8 bits; it is not guaranteed to be
_only_ 8 bits.  That said, POSIX requires that CHAR_BIT == 8.

If you want bytes, use unsigned char. If you want octets, use uint8_t. If
CHAR_BIT > 8, uint8_t won't exist, and your code won't compile (which is
probably what you want).

If a pre-existing API requires `char` (e.g. `strncat`, printf'ing "%s", ...) or
if you're initializing a read-only string (e.g. `const char *hello = "hello";`)
because the C type of string literals (`"hello"`) is `char []`.

In C11 we have native unicode support, and the type of UTF-8 string literals is
still `char *` even for multibyte sequences like `const char *abcgrr =
u8"abc😬";` - but keep in mind, strlen still reports the number of _bytes_ in a
char[], not the number of codepoints.  If you need strong UTF-8 support for
things like parsing and text processing, it's recommended to use [libutf8].

#### Signedness

At no point should you be typing the word `unsigned` into your code. We can now
write code without the ugly C convention of multi-word types that impair
readability as well as usage. Who wants to type `unsigned long long int` when
you can type `uint64_t`? The `<stdint.h>` types are more *explicit*, more
*exact* in meaning, convey *intentions* better, and are more *compact* for
typographic *usage* and *readability*.

But, you may say, "I need to cast pointers to `long` for dirty pointer math!"

You may say that. But you are wrong.

The correct type for pointer math is `uintptr_t` defined in `<stdint.h>`, while
the also useful `ptrdiff_t` is defined in [stddef.h].

Instead of:

    long diff = (long)ptrOld - (long)ptrNew;

Use:

    ptrdiff_t diff = (uintptr_t)ptrOld - (uintptr_t)ptrNew;

Also:

    printf("%p is unaligned by %" PRIuPTR " bytes.\n", (void *)p, ((uintptr_t)somePtr & (sizeof(void *) - 1)));

#### System-Dependent Types

You continue arguing, "on a 32 bit platform I want 32 bit longs and on a 64 bit
platform I want 64 bit longs!"

If we skip over the line of thinking where you are *deliberately* introducing
difficult to reason about code by using two different sizes depending on
platform, you still don't want to use `long` for system-dependent types.

In these situations, you should use `intptr_t`, defined in `<stddef.h> — the
integer type defined to be the word size of your current platform.

On 32-bit platforms, `intptr_t` is normally `int32_t`.

On 64-bit platforms, `intptr_t` is normally `int64_t`.

`intptr_t` also comes in a `uintptr_t` flavor.  It's possible that an
implementation that cannot convert `void*` to an integer type without loss of
information will not define `uintptr_t` - however, such implementations are rare,
perhaps nonexistent.

For holding pointer offsets, we have the aptly named `ptrdiff_t` which is the
proper type for storing values of subtracted pointers.

#### Maximum Value Holders

Do you need an integer type capable of holding any integer usable on
your system?

People tend to use the largest known type in this case, such as casting smaller
unsigned types to `uint64_t`, but there's a more technically correct way to
guarantee any value can hold any other value.

The safest container for any integer is `intmax_t` (also `uintmax_t`). You can
assign or cast any signed integer to `intmax_t` with no loss of precision, and
you can assign or cast any unsigned integer to `uintmax_t` with no loss of
precision.

#### That Other Type

The most widely used system-dependent type is `size_t` and is provided
by [stddef.h].

`size_t` is basically as "is the unsigned integral type of the result of the
sizeof operator" which also means it's capable of holding the largest memory
offset within an object.

In practical use, `size_t` is the return type of `sizeof` operator.

In either case: `size_t` is *practically* defined to be the same as `uintptr_t`
on all modern platforms, so on a 32-bit platform `size_t` is normally
`uint32_t` and on a 64-bit platform `size_t` is normally `uint64_t`.

On modern desktops, `size_t` can represent any offset within your program -
however, in legacy systems (e.g., older x86 systems that exposed addressing with
"near" and "far" pointers), possible future systems that violate the assumption
of pointer consistency, as well as some embedded systems, this is not always
true.

On POSIX, there is also `ssize_t` which is a signed `size_t` used as the return
value from library functions that return `-1` on error.  On Windows systems,
most POSIX functions that return `ssize_t` return `int` instead; you should do
something like this in your program's common types header:

    #ifndef _POSIX_VERSION
    #   ifdef _WIN32
            typedef int ssize_t
    #   endif
    #endif

So, should you use `size_t` for arbitrary system-dependent sizes in your own
function parameters?  Technically, `size_t` is the return type of `sizeof`, so
any functions accepting a size value representing a number of bytes is allowed
to be a `size_t`.

Other uses include: `size_t` is the type of the argument to malloc, and
`ssize_t` is the return type of `read()` and `write()` (except on Windows where
`ssize_t` doesn't exist and the return values are just `int`).

#### Printing Types

You should avoid casting types during printing, opting instead to use proper
type specifiers.

These include, but are not limited to:

* `size_t` - `%zu`
* `ssize_t` - `%zd`
* `ptrdiff_t` - `%td`
* raw pointer value - `%p` (prints hex in modern compilers; cast your pointer
    to `(void *)` first)
* 64-bit types should be printed using `PRIu64` (unsigned) and `PRId64` (signed)
    * on some platforms a 64-bit value is a `long` and on others it's a
        `long long`
    * it is actually impossible to specify a correct cross-platform format
        string without these format macros because the types change out from
        under you (and remember, casting values before printing is not safe or
        logical).
* `intptr_t` — `"%" PRIdPTR`
* `uintptr_t` — `"%" PRIuPTR`
* `intmax_t` — `"%" PRIdMAX`
* `uintmax_t` — `"%" PRIuMAX`

One note about the `PRI*` formatting specifiers: they are *macros* and the
macros expand to proper printf type specifiers on a platform-specific basis.
This means you can't do:

    printf("Local number: %PRIdPTR\n\n", someIntPtr);

but instead, because they are macros, you do:

    printf("Local number: %" PRIdPTR "\n\n", someIntPtr);

Notice you put the `%` *inside* the format string literal within your code, but
the type specifier is *outside* your format string literal.  This is because
all adjacent strings get concatentated by the preprocessor into one final
combined string literal.

### C99 allows variable declarations anywhere

So, do NOT do this:

    void test(uint8_t input) {
        uint32_t b;

        if (input > 3) {
            return;
        }

        b = input;
    }

do THIS instead:

    void test(uint8_t input) {
        if (input > 3) {
            return;
        }

        uint32_t b = input;
    }

Caveat: if you have tight loops, test the placement of your initializers.
Sometimes scattered declarations can cause unexpected slowdowns. For regular
non-fast-path code (which is most of everything in the world), it's best to be
as clear as possible, and defining types next to your initializations is a big
readability improvement.

### C99 allows `for` loops to declare counters inline

So, do NOT do this:

        uint32_t i;

        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)

Do THIS instead:

        for (uint32_t i = 0; i < 10; i++)

One exception: if you need to retain your counter value after the loop exits,
obviously don't declare your counter scoped to the loop itself.

### Modern compilers support `#pragma once`

So, do NOT do this:

    #ifndef PROJECT_HEADERNAME
    #define PROJECT_HEADERNAME
    .
    .
    .
    #endif /* PROJECT_HEADERNAME */

Do THIS instead:

    #pragma once

`#pragma once` tells the compiler to only include your header once and you _do
not_ need three lines of header guards anymore. This pragma is widely supported
across all compilers across all platforms.

For more details, see list of supported compilers at [pragma once].

### C allows static initialization of auto-allocated arrays

So, do NOT do this:

        uint32_t numbers[64];
        memset(numbers, 0, sizeof(numbers));

Do THIS instead:

        uint32_t numbers[64] = {0};

### C allows static initialization of auto-allocated structs

So, do NOT do this:

        struct thing {
            uint64_t index;
            uint32_t counter;
        };

        struct thing localThing;

        void initThing(void) {
            memset(&localThing, 0, sizeof(localThing));
        }

Do THIS instead:

        struct thing {
            uint64_t index;
            uint32_t counter;
        };

        struct thing localThing = {0};

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If your struct has padding, the `{0}` method does not zero
out extra padding bytes. For example, `struct thing` has 4 bytes of padding
after `counter` (on a 64-bit platform) because structs are padded to word-sized
increments. If you need to zero out an entire struct *including* unused
padding, use `memset(&localThing, 0, sizeof(localThing))` because
`sizeof(localThing) == 16 bytes` even though the addressable contents is only
`8 + 4 = 12 bytes`.

If you need to re-initialize already allocated structs, declare a global
zero-struct for later assignment:

        struct thing {
            uint64_t index;
            uint32_t counter;
        };

        static const struct thing localThingNull = {0};
        .
        .
        .
        struct thing localThing = {.counter = 3};
        .
        .
        .
        localThing = localThingNull;

If you are lucky enough to be in a C99 (or newer) environment, you can use
compound literals instead of keeping a global "zero struct" around (also see,
from 2001, [The New C: Compound Literals]).

Compound literals allow you to directly assign from anyonomus structs:

        localThing = (struct thing){0};

### C99 added variable length arrays (C11 made them optional)

So, do NOT do this:

        uintmax_t arrayLength = strtoumax(argv[1], NULL, 10);
        void *array[];

        array = malloc(sizeof(*array) * arrayLength);

        /* remember to free(array) when you're done using it */

Do THIS instead:

        uintmax_t arrayLength = strtoumax(argv[1], NULL, 10);
        void *array[arrayLength];

        /* no need to free array */

**IMPORTANT CAVEAT:** variable length arrays are (usually) stack allocated just
like regular arrays. If you wouldn't create a 3 million element regular array
statically, don't attempt to create a 3 million element array at runtime using
this syntax. These are not scalable python/ruby auto-growing lists. If you
specify a runtime array length and the length is too big for your stack, your
program will do awful things (crashes, security issues). Variable Length Arrays
are convienient for small, single-purpose situations, but should not be relied
on at scale in production software. If sometimes you need a 3 element array and
other times a 3 million element array, definitely do not use the variable
length array capability.

It's good to be aware of the VLA syntax in case you encounter it live (or want
it for quick one-off testing), but it can almost be considered a [dangerous
anti-pattern] since you can crash your programs fairly simple by forgetting
element size bounds checks or by forgetting you are on a strange target
platform with no free stack space.

NOTE: You must be certain `arrayLength` is a reasonable size in this situation.
(i.e. less than a few KB, sometime your stack will max out at 4 KB on weird
platforms). You can't stack allocate *huge* arrays (millions of entries), but
if you know you have a limited count, it's much easier to use [C99 VLA]
capabilities rather than manually requesting heap memory from malloc.

DOUBLE NOTE: there is no user input checking above, so the user can easily kill
your program by allocating a giant VLA. [Some people] go as far to call VLAs an
anti-pattern, but if you keep your bounds tight, it can be a tiny win in
certain situations.

### C99 allows annotating non-overlapping pointer parameters

See the [restrict keyword] (often `__restrict`)

### Parameter Types

If a function accepts **arbitrary** input data and a length to process, don't
restrict the type of the parameter.

So, do NOT do this:

    void processAddBytesOverflow(uint8_t *bytes, uint32_t len) {
        for (uint32_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            bytes[0] += bytes[i];
        }
    }

Do THIS instead:

    void processAddBytesOverflow(void *input, uint32_t len) {
        uint8_t *bytes = input;

        for (uint32_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            bytes[0] += bytes[i];
        }
    }

The input types to your functions describe the *interface* to your code, not
what your code is doing with the parameters. The interface to the code above
means "accept a byte array and a length", so you don't want to restrict your
callers to only uint8\_t byte streams. Maybe your users even want to pass in
old-style `char *` values or something else unexpected.

By declaring your input type as `void *` then re-assigning or re-casting to the
actual type you want inside your function, you save the users of your function
from having to think about abstractions *inside* your own library.

Some readers have pointed out alignment problems with this example, but we are
accessing single byte elements of the input, so everything is fine. If instead
we were casting the input to wider types, we would need to watch out for
alignment issues. For a different write up dealing with cross-platform
alignment issues, see [Unaligned Memory Access]. (reminder: this page of
generic overview details isn't about cross-architecture intricacies of C, so
external knowledge and experience is expected to fully use any examples
provided.)

### Return Parameter Types

C99 gives us the power of `<stdbool.h>` which defines `true` to `1` and `false`
to `0`.

For success/failure return values, functions should return `true` or `false`,
not an `int32_t` return type with manually specifying `1` and `0` (or worse,
`1` and `-1` (or is it `0` success and `1` failure? or is it `0` success and
`-1` failure?)).

If a function mutates an input parameter to the extent the parameter is
invalidated, instead of returning the altered pointer, your entire API should
force double pointers as parameters anywhere an input can be invalidated.
Coding with "for some calls, the return value invalidates the input" is too
error prone for mass usage.

So, do NOT do this:

    void *growthOptional(void *grow, size_t currentLen, size_t newLen) {
        if (newLen > currentLen) {
            void *newGrow = realloc(grow, newLen);
            if (newGrow) {
                /* resize success */
                grow = newGrow;
            } else {
                /* resize failed, free existing and signal failure through NULL */
                free(grow);
                grow = NULL;
            }
        }

        return grow;
    }

Do THIS instead:

    /* Return value:
     *  - 'true' if newLen > currentLen and attempted to grow
     *    - 'true' does not signify success here, the success is still in '*_grow'
     *  - 'false' if newLen <= currentLen */
    bool growthOptional(void **_grow, size_t currentLen, size_t newLen) {
        void *grow = *_grow;
        if (newLen > currentLen) {
            void *newGrow = realloc(grow, newLen);
            if (newGrow) {
                /* resize success */
                *_grow = newGrow;
                return true;
            }

            /* resize failure */
            free(grow);
            *_grow = NULL;

            /* for this function,
             * 'true' doesn't mean success, it means 'attempted grow' */
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

Or, even better, Do THIS instead:

    typedef enum growthResult {
        GROWTH_RESULT_SUCCESS = 1,
        GROWTH_RESULT_FAILURE_GROW_NOT_NECESSARY,
        GROWTH_RESULT_FAILURE_ALLOCATION_FAILED
    } growthResult;

    growthResult growthOptional(void **_grow, size_t currentLen, size_t newLen) {
        void *grow = *_grow;
        if (newLen > currentLen) {
            void *newGrow = realloc(grow, newLen);
            if (newGrow) {
                /* resize success */
                *_grow = newGrow;
                return GROWTH_RESULT_SUCCESS;
            }

            /* resize failure, don't remove data because we can signal error */
            return GROWTH_RESULT_FAILURE_ALLOCATION_FAILED;
        }

        return GROWTH_RESULT_FAILURE_GROW_NOT_NECESSARY;
    }

### Formatting

Coding style is simultaneously very important and utterly worthless.

If your project has a 50 page coding style guideline, nobody will help you.
But, if your code isn't readable, nobody will *want* to help you.

The solution here is to **always** use an automated code formatter.

The only usable C formatter as of 2016 is [clang-format]. clang-format has the
best defaults of any automatic C formatter and is still actively developed.

Here's my preferred script to run clang-format with good parameters:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    clang-format -style="{BasedOnStyle: llvm, IndentWidth: 4, AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: None, KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks: false}" "$@"

Then call it as (assuming you named the script `cleanup-format`):

    matt@foo:~/repos/badcode% cleanup-format -i *.{c,h,cc,cpp,hpp,cxx}

The `-i` option overwrites existing files in place with formatting changes
instead of writing to new files or creating backup files.

If you have many files, you can recursively process an entire source tree
in parallel:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # note: clang-tidy only accepts one file at a time, but we can run it
    #       parallel against disjoint collections at once.
    find . \( -name \*.c -or -name \*.cpp -or -name \*.cc \) |xargs -n1 -P4 cleanup-tidy

    # clang-format accepts multiple files during one run, but let's limit it to 12
    # here so we (hopefully) avoid excessive memory usage.
    find . \( -name \*.c -or -name \*.cpp -or -name \*.cc -or -name \*.h \) |xargs -n12 -P4 cleanup-format -i

Now, there's a new cleanup-tidy script there. The contents of `cleanup-tidy` is:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    clang-tidy \
        -fix \
        -fix-errors \
        -header-filter=.* \
        --checks=readability-braces-around-statements,misc-macro-parentheses \
        $1 \
        -- -I.

[clang-tidy] is policy driven code refactoring tool. The options above enable
two fixups:

* `readability-braces-around-statements` — force all `if`/`while`/`for` statement bodies to be enclosed in braces
    * It's an accident of history for C to have "brace optional" single statements after loop constructs and conditionals. It is *inexcusable* to write modern code without braces enforced on every loop and every conditional. Trying to argue "but, the compiler accepts it!" has *nothing* to do with the readability, maintainability, understandability, or skimability of code. You aren't programming to please your compiler, you are programming to please future people who have to maintain your current brain state years after everybody has forgotten why anything exists in the first place.
* `misc-macro-parentheses` — automatically add parens around all parameters used in macro bodies

`clang-tidy` is great when it works, but for some complex code bases it can get stuck. Also, `clang-tidy` doesn't *format*, so you need to run `clang-format` after you tidy to align new braces and reflow macros.

### Readability

*the writing seems to start slowing down here...*

#### Comments

logical self-contained portions of code file

#### File Structure

Try to limit files to a max of 1,000 lines (1,500 lines in really bad cases).
If your tests are in-line with your source file (for testing static functions,
etc), adjust as necessary.

### misc thoughts

#### Never use `malloc`

You should always use `calloc`. There is no performance penalty for getting
zero'd memory. If you don't like the function protype of `calloc(object count,
size per object)` you can wrap it with `#define mycalloc(N) calloc(1, N)`.

Readers have commented on a few things here:

* `calloc` *does* have a performance impact for **huge** allocations
* `calloc` *does* have a performance impact on weird platforms (minimal embedded systems, game consoles, 30 year old hardware, ...)
* wrapping `calloc(element count, size of each element)` is not always a good idea.
* a good reason to avoid `malloc()` is it can't check for integer overflow and is a potential security risk
* `calloc` allocations remove valgrind's ability to warn you about unintentional reads or copies of uninitialized memory since allocations get initialized to `0` automatically

Those are good points, and that's why we always must do performance testing and
regression testing for speed across compilers, platforms, operating systems,
and hardware devices.

One advantage of using `calloc()` directly without a wrapper is, unlike
`malloc()`, `calloc()` can check for integer overflow because it multiplies its
arguments together to obtain your final allocation size. If you are only
allocating tiny things, wrapping `calloc()` is fine. If you are allocating
potentially unbounded streams of data, you may want to retain the regular
`calloc(element count, size of each element)` calling convention.

No advice can be universal, but trying to give *exactly perfect* generic
recommendations would end up reading like a book of language specifications.

For references on how `calloc()` gives you clean memory for free, see these
nice writeups:

* [Benchmarking fun with calloc() and zero pages (2007)]
* [Copy-on-write in virtual memory management]

I still stand by my recommendation of always using `calloc()` for most common
scenarios of 2016 (assumption: x64 target platforms, human-sized data, not
including human genome-sized data). Any deviations from "expected" drag us into
the pit of despair of "domain knowledge," which are words we shan't speak this
day.

Subnote: The pre-zero'd memory delivered to you by `calloc()` is a one-shot
deal. If you `realloc()` your `calloc()` allocation, the grown memory extended
by realloc is *not* new zero'd out memory. Your grown allocation is filled with
whatever regular uninitialized contents your kernel provides. If you need
zero'd memory after a realloc, you must manually `memset()` the extent of your
grown allocation.

#### Never memset (if you can avoid it)

Never `memset(ptr, 0, len)` when you can statically initialize a structure (or
array) to zero (or reset it back to zero by assigning from an in-line compound
literal or by assigning from a global zero'd out structure).

Though, `memset()` is your only choice if you need to zero out a struct
including its padding bytes (because `{0}` only sets defined fields, not
undefined offsets filled by padding).

### Closing

Writing correct code at scale is essentially impossible. We have multiple
operating systems, runtimes, libraries, and hardware platforms to worry about
without even considering things like random bit flips in RAM or our block
devices lying to us with unknown probability.

The best we can do is write simple, understandable code with as few
indirections and as little undocumented magic as possible.

### Attributions

This made the twitter and HN rounds, so many people helpfully pointed out flaws
or biased thoughts I'm promulgating here.

First up, Jeremy Faller and [Sos Sosowski] and Martin Heistermann and a few
other people were kind enough to point out my `memset()` example was broken and
provided the proper fix.

Martin Heistermann also pointed out the `localThing = localThingNull` example
was broken.

The opening quote about not writing C if you can avoid it is from the wise
internet sage [@badboy\_].

[Remi Gacogne] pointed out I forgot `-Wextra`.

[Levi Pearson] pointed out gcc-5 defaults to gnu11 instead of c89 as well as
clarifying the default clang mode.

[Christopher] pointed out the `-O2` vs `-O3` section could use a little more
clarification.

[Chad Miller] pointed out I was being lazy in the clang-format script params.

[Many] people also pointed out the `calloc()` advice isn't *always* a good idea
if you have extreme circumstances or non-standard hardware (examples of bad
ideas: huge allocations, allocations on embedded jiggers, allocations on 30
year old hardware, etc).

Charles Randolph pointed out I misspelled the world "Building."

Sven Neuhaus pointed out kindly I also do not posess the ability to spell
"initialization" or "initializers." (and also pointed out I misspelled
"initialization" wrong the first time here as well)

[Colm MacCárthaigh] pointed out I forgot to mention `#pragma once`.

[Jeffrey Yasskin] pointed out we should kill strict aliasing too (mainly a gcc
optimization).

Jeffery Yasskin also provided better wording around the
`-fno-strict-aliasing` section.

[Chris Palmer] and a few others pointed out calloc-vs-malloc parameter
advantages and the overall drawback of writing a wrapper for `calloc()` because
`calloc()` provides a more secure interface than `malloc()` in the first place.

Damien Sorresso pointed out we should remind people `realloc()` doesn't zero
out grown memory after an initial zero'd `calloc()` request.

Pat Pogson pointed out I was unable to spell the word "declare" correctly
as well.

[@TopShibe] pointed out the stack-allocated initialization example was wrong
because the examples I gave were global variables. Updated wording to just mean
"auto-allocated" things, be it stack or data sections.

[Jonathan Grynspan][dangerous anti-pattern] suggested harsher wording around
the VLA example because they **are** dangerous when used incorrectly.

David O'Mahony kindly pointed out I can't spell "specify" either.

Dr. David Alan Gilbert pointed out `ssize_t` is a POSIXism and Windows either
doesn't have it or defines `ssize_t` as an *unsigned* quantity which obviously
introduces all kinds of fun behavior when your type is signed on POSIX
platforms and unsigned on Windows.

Chris Ridd suggested we explicitly mention C99 is C from 1999 and C11 is C from
2011 because otherwise it looks strange having 11 be newer than 99.

Chris Ridd also noticed the `clang-format` example used unclear naming
conventions and suggested better consistency across examples.

[Anthony Le Goff] pointed us to a book-length treatment of many modern C ideas
called [Modern C].

Stuart Popejoy pointed out my inaccurate spelling of deliberately was truly
inaccurate.

jack rosen pointed out my usage of the word 'exists' does not mean 'exits' as I
intended.

Jo Booth pointed out I like to spell compatibility as compatability, which
seems more logical, but English commonality disagrees.

Stephen Anderson decoded my aberrant spelling of 'stil' back into 'still.'

Richard Weinberger pointed out struct initialization with `{0}` doesn't zero
out padding bytes, so sending a `{0}` struct over the wire can leak unintended
bytes on under-specified structs.

[@JayBhukhanwala] pointed out the function comment in [Return Parameter Types]
was inaccurate because I didn't update the comment when the code changed (story
of our lives, right?).

Lorenzo pointed out we should explicitly provide a warning concerning potential
cross-platform alignment issues in section [Parameter Types].

[Paolo G. Giarrusso] re-clarified the alignment warning I previously added to
be more correct regarding the examples given.

Fabian Klötzl provided the valid struct compound literal assignment example
since it's perfectly valid syntax I just hadn't run across before.

Omkar Ekbote provided a very thorough walkthrough of typos and consistency
problems here including that I couldn't spell "platform," "actually,"
"defining," "experience," "simultaneously," "readability," as well as noted
some other unclear wordings.

Carlo Bellettini fixed my aberrant spelling of the word aberrant.

[Keith S Thompson][Keith S. Thompson] provided many technical corrections in
his great article [how-to-c-response].

Many people on reddit went apeshit because this article originally had
`#import` somewhere by mistake. Sorry, crazy people, but this started out as an
unedited and unreviewed year old draft when originally pushed live. The error
has since been remedied.

Some people also pointed out the static initialization example uses globals
which are always initialized to zero by default anyway (and that they aren't
even initialized, they are statically allocated). This is a poor choice of
example on my part, but the concepts still stand for typical usage within
function scopes. The examples were meant to be any generic "code snippet" and
not necessarily top level globals.

A few people seem to have read this as an "I hate C" page, but it isn't. C is
dangerous in the wrong hands (not enough testing, not enough experience when
widely deployed), so paradoxically the two kinds of C developers should only be
novice hobbyists (code failure causes no problems, it's just a toy) or people
who are willing to test their asses off (code failure causes life or financial
loss, it's not just a toy) should be writting C code for production usage.
There's not much room for "casual observer C development." For the rest of the
world, that's why we have Erlang.

Many people have also mentioned their own pet issues as well or issues beyond
the scope of this article (including new C11 only features like [George
Makrydakis] reminding us about C11 generic abilities).

Perhaps another article about "Practical C" will show up to cover testing,
profiling, performance tracing, optional-but-useful warning levels, etc.
